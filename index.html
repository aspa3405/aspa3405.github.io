                <h2>Aspiring graphic designer</h2>
                <p>I am a third year student at the University of Colorado Boulder
                majoring in Creative Technology and Design with a certificate
                Engineering Leadership.
                I have been looking forward to taking this class and expanding my
                understanding of coding and how to build a website! I hope to grow in
                those skills as well as creativity and technological understadning in
                general.
                Throughout my life I have grown in my passion for design, art, creativity and 
                when I realized I could pursue my passion in a career, it made my college experience so much
                sweeter.  Now I am committed to learning new skills and tools to expand my experience
                in the realm of graphic design and who knows... maybe UI/UX design:)
