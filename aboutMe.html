    <ul id="facts">
        <li>A newer fact about me is that I recently got engaged! ("awww how cute... blah blah blah") We will see what happens with planning but we are hoping to get married over the summer. This was was such a sweet surprise with our families celebrating with us. (Photo credit to my sister)</li>
        <li>I am the middle of 5 children, with two older sisters, two brothers in law and two younger brothers (and two bernese mountain dogs; Bailey and Pippa).</li>
        <li>This semester, after taking a class focused on graphic design, I feel more confident in pursuing that as my career in whatever opporotunities come my way.  Next semester I hope to start in an internship to grow in my skills and further my career. 
        <li>In my free time I enjoy board games, reading, running, baking, painting, sketching and growing my design portfolio! I created it myself in Adobe Illustrator.  Here it is below!</li>
